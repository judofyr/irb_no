Contributing
------------

If you want to contribute sample code, jokes, recipes or anything that isn't illegal, immoral or fattening, just fork this repo and send a pull request. We could organize contributions by meetup date, see the example dir for november 11. If that sounds like a good solution, fork the repo, add sample code to the dir for a given meetup date, commit, push and send a pull request.
